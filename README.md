HoMeNu is a personal project aimed at managing the daily menu in an ordinary house.
Once you have registered as a user you can:
1) Register as many dishes as you want (macaroni with tomato, french fries, roast beef and so on)
2) Register "Meals", understood as groupings of dishes (breakfast, lunch and dinner, for example)
3) Manage the Menu of each day including several Dishes in different Menus.
4) Take a quick look at your HoMe MeNu on the calendar.

It is developed using the **following technology**:
* Python for business logic.
* Flask + Bootstrap + JQuery for the interface.
* SQLite for the database.
